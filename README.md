CMOS Inverter & Logic Gates Layout Design Project | Electric VLSI Design System | TSMC 180nm Technology Node

Layout Design: Developed detailed layouts for a CMOS inverter and various logic gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, EX-OR, EX-NOR) using the Electric VLSI Design System. Leveraged TSMC 180nm technology node to ensure modern, efficient design standards.

Verification: Successfully verified the behavior of all logic gates using Design Rule Check (DRC), Electrical Rule Check (ERC), and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) checks, ensuring adherence to design rules and accurate schematic matches.

Simulations: Conducted thorough simulations to confirm the functional correctness and performance of the designed logic gates.

Parasitic Extraction: Performed parasitic extraction to analyze the impact of parasitic components on the circuit's performance, ensuring high reliability and optimal performance of the final designs.

This project showcases proficiency in VLSI design, verification, and simulation, with a strong focus on accuracy and adherence to industry standards. The use of Electric VLSI Design System and TSMC 180nm technology underscores a commitment to utilizing advanced tools and technologies in the field of integrated circuit design.
